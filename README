--------------------

This full example of a PyMC project compares several ways of modeling
the relationship between Total Fertility Rate (TFR) and Human
Development Index (HDI), the subject of the "Fertility-development
controversy" [1].

It is a useful example, and additional background details are
described in the Healthy Algorithms blog [2].
